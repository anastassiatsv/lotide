## Usage

**Install it:**

`npm install @anastassia_tsvetkova/lotide`

**Require it:**

`const _ = require('@anastassia_tsvetkova/lotide');`

**Call it:**

`const results = _.tail([1, 2, 3]) // => [2, 3]`

## Documentation

The following functions are currently implemented:

* `assertArraysEqual`: this function takes two arrays as input and prints assertion passed if two arrays are the same and assertion failed if not.
* `assertEqual`: this function takes two arguments that are primitive type and pritns assertion passed if two arguments are the same and assertion failed if not.
* `assertObjectsEqual`: this function takes two objects as input and prints assertion passed if two objects are the same and assertion failed if not.
* `countLetter`: this function takes a string and returns the object that contains each letters as key and the he number of key occurrences as value.
* `countOnly`: this function counts the number of the items that are passed by user and return the object that contains item as key and count as value.
* `eqArrays`: this function returns true if two arrays are the same and false if not.
* `eqObjects`: this function returns true if two objects are the smae and false if not.
* `findKey`: this function takes an object and a function that takes an object. this function returns a key when the arugment function returns true with the object.
* `findKeyByValue`: takes an input object and value and returns the key that contains that value
* `head`: this function takes an array and returns the first element in the array.
* `index`: this exports three functions(head,tail,middle) simultaneously.
* `letterPositions`: this function takes a string and returns letters with positions in an object type.
* `map`: this function takes an array and function to map the array. It returns a mapped array.
* `middle`: this function takes an array and returns the element in the middle index.
* `tail`: this function takes an array and excludes the first element.
* `takeUntil`: this function takes and array and a function and returns the array where its elements are deleted when the callback function returns false.
